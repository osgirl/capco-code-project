## Setup

To clone and run this application, you'll first need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed to your local development environment.  
With those installed, open your terminal application and do the following:  

```bash
# Clone down this repo
$ git clone https://github.com/randallwhitlock/capco-code-project

# Navigate into the freshly cloned repo
$ cd capco-code-project

# Install the project's dependencies
$ npm install

# run the dev server:
$ npm run dev
```
Note: the dev server runs both the server and the client and allows for the api endpoint to be accessed from the browser

## <strong>My Process</strong>

## Client

Implemented in React using Flexbox after a learning experience with CSS Grid.  

### React

A library built by Facebook known for its use of custom components to build complex web applications.

Installation:
```js
npm install --save react react-dom
```
### Flexbox

Flexbox comes prebaked into CSS.  To learn more, <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com">try this cool game</a> or take a look at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox">the MDN docs</a>.

## Server

### Express

Express.js is a minimal framework built on top of Node.js that is known for it's minimalism, allowing for the developer to control the interactions that it has with the client at a lower level.

Installation:

```js
npm install --save express
```

#### Middleware

Middleware perform important functions and transform the data that is being sent out from browsers.  My implementations were mostly unnecessary for a project of this scale.

**Todo: Update info on middleware**

### Currently

Fixing the layout and transitions

### Todo: Deploy!
